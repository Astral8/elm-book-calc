# Book Conversion in Elm

A simple small program written in Elm for converting between the number of words and pages.

The app can opened using the `index.html` file or accessed through its deployment on [Github Pages](https://astral8.github.io/elm-book-calc/).

The Book Calculator simply utilizes the concept that each page has 250 words. So 10 pages would have 2500 words while 500 words would be 2 pages and so on.

The Project was created with the idea of familiarizing myself with Elm's formatting and seeing how it converts a program into a HTML file. It also was done specifically with the purpose of seeing how to do conversion live without the use of a button.

The Project was developed in `src/Main.elm` and then outputted into `index.html`. It also utilizes the Elm module for [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) that was developed by [Matheus23](https://github.com/matheus23) and can be found [here](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/matheus23/elm-default-tailwind-modules/latest/).

Based on the [Temperature Converter](https://github.com/JesterXL/temperature-converter-elm) by [JesterXL](https://github.com/JesterXL).
