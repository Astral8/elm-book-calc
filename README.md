# Book Conversion in Elm

A simple small Elm program for converting between the number of words and pages.

Utilizes the concept that each page has 250 words. So 10 pages would have 2500 words while 500 words would be 2 pages and so on.

Was created with the idea of familiarizing myself with Elm's formatting. Also with the purpose of seeing how to do conversion live without the use of a button.

Project is structured so `index.html` starts the Elm app while `src/Main.elm` handles everything else.


Based on the [Temperature Converter](https://github.com/JesterXL/temperature-converter-elm) by [JesterXL](https://github.com/JesterXL).
